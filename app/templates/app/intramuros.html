        Founded in 1571 by Spanish conquistador Miguel LÃ³pez de Legazpi, it served as the seat of Spanish colonial power in the Philippines for over 300 years.
        <br><br>
        The city was meticulously planned and fortified with thick stone walls, moats, and bastions to protect it from attacks.
        <br><br>
        Intramuros was the center of religious, political, and economic life during the Spanish colonial period. It housed government offices, churches, convents, schools, and residences of the Spanish elite.
