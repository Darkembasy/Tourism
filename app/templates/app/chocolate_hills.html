    <h1>The Chocolate Hills of Bohol</h1>

    <p>
        The Chocolate Hills are a geological formation in **Bohol**, Philippines, renowned for their unique appearance.
        They are estimated to number between 1,268 and 1,776, scattered across a vast area in the **Carmen** municipality.
        These hills are formed from uplifted coral reefs from the ocean floor, sculpted over millions of years by weathering and erosion.

        </ul>
        <br><br>
        During the rainy season, the hills are covered in lush green grass.
        However, during the dry season, the grass turns brown, giving the hills their distinctive "chocolate" color.
        This seasonal color change is the source of their captivating name.
        <br><br>
        The hills vary in height, ranging from 30 to 50 meters, with the tallest reaching 120 meters.
        <br><br>
        **Formation:**
        <ul>
            <li>Millions of years ago, the area was submerged beneath the sea.</li>
            <li>Remains of marine organisms, such as corals and mollusks, accumulated on the seafloor, forming layers of limestone.</li>
            <li>Tectonic movements uplifted the seafloor, bringing the limestone formations above sea level.</li>
            <li>Over time, weathering (like rain and wind) and erosion sculpted the limestone into the distinctive conical shapes.</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>
        **Cultural Significance:**
        <ul>
            <li>The Chocolate Hills are a significant natural landmark and a major tourist attraction in the Philippines.</li>
            <li>Local legend attributes their formation to a battle between two giants who threw rocks and sand at each other.</li>
            <li>They are a protected area, declared the third National Geological Monument of the Philippines.</li>
            <li>Efforts are underway to have them included in the UNESCO World Heritage List.</li>
        </ul>
