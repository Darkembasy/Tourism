    <h1>Mayon Volcano: The Perfect Cone</h1>

    <p>
        Mayon Volcano, often referred to as the "Perfect Cone" for its symmetrical shape, is an active stratovolcano in the province of
        **Albay**, Philippines. It is located in the Bicol Region, specifically in the city of
        **Legazpi**.
        <br><br>
        Its near-perfect conical form is a result of numerous eruptions and lava flows over thousands of years.
        Mayon is renowned for its picturesque beauty, drawing tourists and inspiring artists alike.
        However, this beauty belies the volcano's destructive potential, as it is one of the most active volcanoes in the Philippines.
